# Snake-Game

# Introduction
This is a simple snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game is a classic representation of the popular snake game, where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. As the snake grows, the player must avoid collisions with the walls or the snake itself. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score before the game ends.

# Gameplay
The player controls the snake using the arrow keys or WSAD keys on the keyboard. The snake moves continuously in the direction it is facing. The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen, which causes the snake's length to increase. With each food eaten, the player scores points. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game window or if it collides with itself.
